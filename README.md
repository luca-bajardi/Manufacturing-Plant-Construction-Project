# Manufacturing Plant Construction Project
 
This work is aimed at simulating a real process of preparing a technical-economic offer for the construction of some parts of an industrial plant (building and a processing line for motor vehicle heads), as part of a tender for international procurement. The offer will consist of graphic and descriptive drawings according to the specifications provided.

The exercise (carried out in teams) intends to simulate a real professional situation: each group must imagine being a proposal team operating within a construction engineering & contracting company.

During the final evaluation of the exercise, the teachers will represent the client who requested the offer and who must award the order to the best contractor according to the most economically advantageous offer according to the criteria set out in the RFP.
